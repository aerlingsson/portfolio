## Arnar Haukur Erlingsson - Portfolio

Each branch is a separate project. The readme file of each branch gives a short description of the project and, in some cases, a more in-depth documentation.
This repository is also available in a more readable format at: https://aerlingsson.github.io/.

**Disclaimer: This repository does not represent how I interact with version control in a project setting**
